# Volatus-Aerospace-demo-website

--Developed By: Shashank Daksh--

## Project Overview
This project is a full-stack redesign of the [Volatus Aerospace](https://volatusaerospace.com) website, implemented with modern web technologies. The frontend is built with **React** (using Wouter for routing) and **Tailwind CSS** for styling, and the backend is a **Node.js/Express** API. The site features dynamic elements like video backgrounds, animated counters, and interactive cards. Key pages include Home, About, Contact, Training, Equipment, and various Services and Industries sections. The application integrates with a PostgreSQL database (using Drizzle ORM) to handle contact inquiries, newsletter subscriptions, and quote requests.
